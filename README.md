## Client Server Final Project

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
1. Modular design
Making sure to break down the application into smaller working pieces. This makes the code easier to follow and understand.
2. Clear and Concise Naming Conventions
Using descriptive naming conventions allows for insight into the usage of a variable, class or function.
3. Documentation and comments
Providing clear documentation and comments to the code is detrimental for transparency. For people who are reviewing your code or even yourself later on, it allows people to familiarize themselves with the functionality in a timely manor
4. Testing and Debugging

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
