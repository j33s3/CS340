## Client Server Final Project

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
#### 1. Modular design
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making sure to break down the application into smaller working pieces. This makes the code easier to follow and understand.
#### 2. Clear and Concise Naming Conventions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using descriptive naming conventions allows for insight into the usage of a variable, class or function.
#### 3. Documentation and comments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing clear documentation and comments to the code is detrimental for transparency. For people who are reviewing your code or even yourself later on, it allows people to familiarize themselves with the functionality in a timely manner
#### 4. Testing and Debugging
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing and Debugging code is among the most important part for makeing your code maintainable. Testing your code helps you to locate any errors and room for improvement.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
This project was different from all of my previous course work, since I was building an application front and back. We worked on the Mongo database first and then started implementing a user interface. In this course, the approach started at the lowest level. First, we ensured the database was operational and that the queries were operational using MongoSH. Then we developed python code using the dash framework. The Python code first displayed an interactive table with the data from our Mongo database. Gradually, we added a map for displaying coordinates and a chart for visualizing the data. When developing an app front and back such as this project. I will work from the back to ensure that the data is functional. Then I will work through how the data will be utilized on the front end.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientist have many different jobs.
#### 1. Problem-Solving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main job of computer scientists is to be problem solvers. Solving new and existing problems of our ever-changing world.
#### 2. Data Management
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Scientists often times have to manage large amounts of data. They constantly  need to optimize systems for faster response times. They also can use data to train algorithms and personalize applications.
#### 3. Software Development
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will often times develop software that must be secure, efficient and user-friendly.
#### 4. Automation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, computer scientists will be tasked with the role of automating tasks. This helps companies to reallocate labor and save money

Working on a project such as Grazioso Salvare allows a company to skip the daunting task of searching physical filing systems. It saves companies lots of money and also space on their property.
